1st commit: Here the test Cases are failing. if we remove application.properties in test folder it will work fine because,
the configurations are given in the src app.props. if we create another in test it will take the configurations from the app.props in test. 
If we want to use it in test also, then we have to configure the same properties in here same as main.
